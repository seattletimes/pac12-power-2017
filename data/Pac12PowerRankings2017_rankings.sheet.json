UW must shore up the running game, which gained just 84 yards and find alternate downfield receiving targets other than Dante Pettis. This week: Against Montana."

The Trojans wonâ€™t stay unbeaten for long unless they fix a leaky run defense that allowed 263 yards. QB Sam Darnold tossed 2 INTs and failed to throw a touchdown in his first start, which put a chill on his Heisman Trophy campaign. This week: Against Stanford."
